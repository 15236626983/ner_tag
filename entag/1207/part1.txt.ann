[@U.S.#Gpe*] [@Special Operations Command#Org*] is ramping up its efforts to develop "[@cutting-edge data techniques#ai_program*]" like [@artificial intelligence#ai_tec*] to boost readiness and minimize costs. As part of that initiative, the command unveiled its new [@Data Engineering Lab#MISC*] located at the [@SOFWERX#Org*] facility in [@Tampa#Gpe*], [@Florida#Gpe*], on [@Wednesday#Date*]. [@SOFWERX#Org*] was established under a partnership intermediary agreement with [@SOCOM#Org*] and [@DEFENSEWERX#Org*], formerly known as the [@Doolittle Institute#Org*], to help address war fighter problems for the command. The lab was designed to cultivate [@AI#ai_tec*], [@machine learning#ai_tec*], and [@robotic process automation#ai_tec*] â€” all to boost the performance and strength of special operations forces, [@SOCOM#Org*] spokeswoman Army Maj. [@Jennifer Bocanegra#Person*] told the [@Military Times#MISC*]. "The [@DEL#ai_product*] is modeled off of leading technology companies, where [@DoD#Org*] partners, industry thought leaders, academia and [@Special Operations Forces#MISC*] collaborate to develop, test and employ new technical approaches to modernize warfighting decision making," [@Bocanegra#Person*] said in an email to the [@Military Times#MISC*]. Already, several projects are underway at the [@DEL#ai_product*], according to [@Bocanegra#Person*]. Along with the [@Pentagon#MISC*]'s [@Joint Artificial Intelligence Center#Org*], the [@DEL#ai_product*] is working on a project supporting the 160th [@Special Operations Aviation Regiment#MISC*] based at [@Fort Campbell#MISC*] in [@Kentucky#Gpe*] to use [@AI#ai_tec*] and [@machine learning#ai_tec*] technology to help predict and prevent key mechanical issues, and to enhance the effectiveness of aircraft maintenance, among other things. "This project is in its early stages, but initial data collection, analysis and use of results have resulted in a significant increase in readiness, at cost savings," [@Bocanegra#Person*] said. A ribbon cutting ceremony for the opening of the lab was held on [@Wednesday#Date*], and included remarks from [@SOCOM#Org*] commander, Army Gen. [@Richard Clarke#Person*] and [@SOCOM#Org*] Chief Data Officer David Spirk. [@SOCOM#Org*]'s [@Data Engineering Lab#MISC*] grand opening took place in [@Ybor City#Gpe*] in [@Tampa#Gpe*] yesterday. The [@DEL#ai_product*] is specifically designed to develop and leverage cutting edge data techniques, including [@AI#ai_tec*] & [@machine learning#ai_tec*], to enhance [@SOF#MISC*] effectiveness and capabilities... [@Spirk#Org*] joined [@SOCOM#Org*] in [@2018#Date*], after working with the [@Department of Defense#Org*]'s [@Project Maven#ai_program*] Program that launched in [@April 2017#Date*]. The [@artificial intelligence#ai_tec*] program is designed to use [@machine learning#ai_tec*] and [@artificial intelligence#ai_tec*] to process full-motion video. The new lab comes as [@SOCOM#Org*] is composing a new [@artificial intelligence#ai_tec*] and [@machine learning#ai_tec*] strategy as part of its program objective memorandum for fiscal years [@2022 to 2026#Date*]. At the time, [@Spirk#Org*] said [@Special Operations Forces#MISC*] components would start crafting the strategy starting in [@September#Date*]. "We're going to start the crafting of a real roadmap," he said at the [@Special Operations Forces Industry Conference#MISC*] in [@May#Date*], according to [@National Defense#Org*]. "This will help the command...talk about the investments we need to make and the resources that we're going to need."The [@DEL#ai_product*] will be overseen by [@SOCOM#Org*]'s Data Office, but will be housed in [@SOFWERX#Org*]'s facility in [@Tampa#Gpe*]'s [@Ybor City#Gpe*]. [@SOFWERX#Org*] and the new data lab will both address solutions for special operator needs, [@Bocanegra#Person*] said. "Being co-located provides opportunities for the [@DEL#ai_product*] and [@SOFWERX#Org*] to collaborate on future challenges for the [@Special Operations community#MISC*]," [@Bocanegra#Person*] said.
