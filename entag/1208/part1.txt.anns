Gen. O

Clarke I-Person
Clarke I-Person
, O
the O
new O
head O
of O
SOCOM B-Org
, O
described O
how O
machine B-ai_tec

and O
AI B-ai_tec
can O
provide O
operators O
with O
tactical O
advantages O
by O
increasing O
situational O
awareness, O
reducing O
cognitive O
loads O
and O
improving O
the O
decision-making O
process. O
"There O
are O
new, O
innovative O
ways O
to O
bring O
this O
reality O
to O
the O
forefront," O
Spirk B-Person
told O
C4ISRNET. B-MISC
One O
of O
the O
most O
relevant O
SOCOM B-Org
programs O
that O
could O
significantly O
benefit O
from O
machine B-ai_tec

and O
AI B-ai_tec
is O

"The O
HEO B-ai_product
concept O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
things O
SOCOM B-Org
can O
be O
doing O
right O
now," O
Spirk B-Person
said. O
"The O
only O
way O
we O
have O
HEO B-ai_product
in O
the O
future O
is O
if O
we O
can O
reduce O
the O
cognitive O
load O
of O
that O
operator O
and O
his O
ability O
to O
command O
his O
resources O
at O
his O
disposal O
through O
automation O
and O
applied O
AI B-ai_tec
." O
For O
example, O
machine B-ai_tec
learning I-ai_tec
and O
AI B-ai_tec
could O
help O
to O
process, O
exploit O
and O
disseminate O
data O
from O
intelligence, O
surveillance, O
and O
reconnaissance. O
Such O
an O
advantage O
could O
come O
in O
the O
form O
of O
new O
displays O
available O
to O
operators O
in O
the O
field. O
That O
technology O
could O
also O
improve O
automation O
at O
tactical O
operation O
centers, O
in O
turn O
providing O
special O
operations O
forces O
with O
mission-specific O
predictions, O
Spirk B-Person
noted. O
Before O

to O
design O
computer-vision B-ai_tec
algorithms I-ai_tec
for O
the O
processing, O
exploitation O
and O

of O

The O
command O
is O
working O
to O
exploit O
machine B-ai_tec
learning I-ai_tec
and O
AI B-ai_tec
technologies O
across O
an O
increasingly O
complex O
operating O
environment, O
and O
Spirk B-Person
emphasized O
SOCOM B-Org
's O
mission O
to O
adhere O
to O

AI B-ai_tec
principles: O
