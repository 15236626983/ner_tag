As the first-ever chief data officer at the [@U.S.#Gpe*] [@Special Operations Command#Org*], or [@SOCOM#Org*], [@David Spirk Jr.#Person*] is tasked with managing the high expectations of the [@Tampa#Gpe*], [@Florida-based#Gpe*] organization. He is now celebrating his one-year anniversary on the job. In a [@May#Date*] speech, Gen. [@Richard Clarke Clarke#Person*], the new head of [@SOCOM#Org*], described how [@machine learning#ai_tec*] and [@AI#ai_tec*] can provide operators with tactical advantages by increasing situational awareness, reducing cognitive loads and improving the decision-making process. "There are new, innovative ways to bring this reality to the forefront," [@Spirk#Person*] told [@C4ISRNET.#MISC*] One of the most relevant [@SOCOM#Org*] programs that could significantly benefit from [@machine learning#ai_tec*] and [@AI#ai_tec*] is the [@Hyper Enabled Operator concept#ai_product*]. [@HEO#ai_product*] replaces the five-year [@Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit#MISC*] effort. "The [@HEO#ai_product*] concept is one of the most important things [@SOCOM#Org*] can be doing right now," [@Spirk#Person*] said. "The only way we have [@HEO#ai_product*] in the future is if we can reduce the cognitive load of that operator and his ability to command his resources at his disposal through automation and applied [@AI#ai_tec*]." For example, [@machine learning#ai_tec*] and [@AI#ai_tec*] could help to process, exploit and disseminate data from intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. Such an advantage could come in the form of new displays available to operators in the field. That technology could also improve automation at tactical operation centers, in turn providing special operations forces with mission-specific predictions, [@Spirk#Person*] noted. Before joining [@SOCOM#Org*], [@Spirk#Person*] worked with the [@Department of Defense#Org*]'s [@Project Maven#ai_program*] program, which was started in [@April 2017#Date*] to design [@computer-vision algorithms#ai_tec*] for the processing, exploitation and dissemination of full-motion video. The command is working to exploit [@machine learning#ai_tec*] and [@AI#ai_tec*] technologies across an increasingly complex operating environment, and [@Spirk#Person*] emphasized [@SOCOM#Org*]'s mission to adhere to special operations forces' [@AI#ai_tec*] principles: grow the discipline, find a purpose-driven application and make it the norm. "Quick wins are demanded," [@Spirk#Person*] said. [@SOCOM#Org*]'s [@Command Data Office#Org*] completed its first program review [@July 24#Date*] â€” an event [@Clarke#Person*] attended. Previous leaders also gave him "explicit guidance to go faster and deeper while responsibly challenging legacy policies or processes that get in the way of our progress," [@Spirk#Person*] said. Such a strategy, he warned, is dependent upon cooperation across [@SOCOM#Org*]; the [@Command Data Office#Org*] in particular is tasked with identifying the most optimal means of creating an [@AI-ready workforce#ai_product*].
