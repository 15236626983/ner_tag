Challenges associated with the use of [@artificial intelligence#ai_tec*] throughout the [@federal government#Org*] include eliminating bias, preparing the workforce and defining ethical use. But increased use of [@AI#ai_tec*] also poses a challenge to inspectors general: How do they provide oversight of this technology? The inspector general for the Office of the Director of [@National Intelligence#Org*] detailed in its [@Semiannual Report#MISC*], released [@Nov. 25#Date*], how it's working to improve [@AI#ai_tec*] programs within the intelligence community. According the report, the [@IG#MISC*]s in the [@intel community#MISC*] face "mounting" challenges posed by discovering, sorting and analyzing large amounts of data. Thus, the inspector general of the intelligence community, or [@ICIG#MISC*], "selected [@artificial intelligence#ai_tec*] as an objective for review due to the presence it has played in multiple documents and reports published by [@ODNI#Org*]." To better communication between [@IG#MISC*]s across the [@intel community#MISC*], the [@ICIG#MISC*] has "begun exploring" the creation of an [@IG#MISC*] community of interest to induce collaboration between several [@IG#MISC*] offices, including those of the departments of Justice, State, Defense, Energy and Treasury, as well as the FBI. To better the [@ICIG#MISC*]'s understanding of the how the [@intel community#MISC*] uses [@AI#ai_tec*], and to enhance the inspectors general's audit capabilities, the [@ICIG#MISC*] has turned to government experts, academia and industry to begin "mapping the landscape" of [@AI#ai_tec*]-related work happening under its purview. The [@intel community#MISC*] is working on [@AI#ai_tec*] projects under a strategy document created under former Director of [@National Intelligence#Org*] [@Dan Coats#Person*], titled "[@Augmenting Intelligence using Machines#ai_program*] ([@AIM#ai_program*]) Initiative." That strategy identified [@AI#ai_tec*] as a technology that could improve data interpretation and mission capability. As different intel agencies moved forward with [@AI#ai_tec*] projects, the [@ICIG#MISC*] began compiling a list of existing and planned [@AI#ai_tec*] projects. The list, combined with other [@ICIG#MISC*] efforts to engage with [@AI#ai_tec*] efforts across government and industry, will "advance [@Intelligence Community Offices of Inspectors General#Org*]'s ability to develop criteria and measures for evaluating investments in oversight of [@artificial intelligence#ai_tec*] in terms of personnel, training, and technology." The use of emerging technology also presents the [@ICIG#MISC*] with workforce challenges. The [@ICIG#MISC*] has compiled a list of available course offerings within the government and academia that could "substantively broaden and deepen" the inspectors general's expertise in data and [@AI#ai_tec*]. The [@ICIG#MISC*] has also "expanded" its previous engagements with the [@Council of the Inspectors General#Org*] on Integrity and Efficiency, an federal inspectors general group working to better government [@IG#MISC*] offices. The [@ICIG#MISC*] pointed to the group's data analytics working group and its emerging technology subcommittee as important areas for the [@ICIG#MISC*] to engage. "The [@ICIG#MISC*] continues its work to enable shared situational awareness within the [@Inspector General community#Org*], both in the [@Intelligence Community#Org*] and the broader [@federal government#Org*]," the report read.
