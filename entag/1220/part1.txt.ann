[@WASHINGTON#Gpe*]: When former Deputy Defense Secretary [@Bob Work#Person*] heard the head of [@Google#Org*]'s parent company, [@Eric Schmidt#Person*], say this morning that [@America#Gpe*] needs a national strategy for developing [@Artificial Intelligence#ai_tec*], one image sprang to his mind's eye. "The image that popped into my mind was of [@Nikita Khrushchev#Person*] banging his shoe in the [@UN#Org*] and saying, 'We will bury you," [@Work#Person*] said. [@Work#Person*] told me [@Schmidt#Person*] was "absolutely right" to call for [@America#Gpe*] to come up with its own strategic plan to boost its work on [@AI#ai_tec*], as [@China#Gpe*] recently did. "As [@Eric#Person*] said, the [@US#Gpe*] does not have a coherent strategy" for developing [@AI#ai_tec*], said [@Work#Person*], father of the [@Pentagon#Org*]'s [@Third Offset Strategy#MISC*]. [@China#Gpe*]'s just announced an [@AI#ai_tec*] strategy designed to assure it will be dominant in the host of technologies by [@2030#Date*]. "If you believe this is important, as I believe, then we need to get our act together as a country," [@Schmidt#Person*] said this morning. In a Q and A session at the event organized by the [@Center for a New American Security#Org*], [@Schmidt#Person*] said he thought the [@US#Gpe*] will maintain its lead over the [@People's Republic of China#Gpe*] for the next five years, but he expects [@China#Gpe*] to catch up about then and pass us "extremely quickly." How important does [@China#Gpe*] think [@AI#ai_tec*] can be? [@Work#Person*] told me the [@Chinese#Gpe*] estimate they can boost economic growth with [@AI#ai_tec*] by 26 percent by [@2030#Date*]. "It's quite stunning," [@Work#Person*] said. And, of course, the [@PRC's government#Org*] has published a national strategy and released it to the world. What's the best response by the [@United States#Gpe*], I asked [@Work#Person*] after [@Schmidt#Person*] spoke. The federal government needs to answer this question at its highest levels, as happened after the [@Soviet Union#Gpe*] stunned the world and launched the first satellite, [@Sputnik#MISC*], [@Work#Person*] said. This is not something the [@Pentagon#Org*] can fix by itself. The [@US#Gpe*] should, at least, offer a free education "a free ride" to promising [@AI#ai_tec*] students, the former deputy defense secretary said. In return, they would agree to serve in an [@AI#ai_tec*] reserve corps, something like a cross between the [@Reserves#Org*] and [@National Guard#Org*]. They could work for [@Alphabet#Org*], [@Facebook#Org*] or any other company and make lots of money while also providing their unique skills to their country. A colleague and I pressed [@Work#Person*], asking him if [@America#Gpe*] was likely to undertake such a major effort, barring a catalytic event that strikes fear into the voting public, as [@Sputnik#MISC*] did. His reply is worth noting: "If we wait for the [@Sputnik#MISC*] moment, we will be too far behind." In related news, [@Work#Person*] said he understands the [@Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team#Org*] is on track to deploy its first algorithm by [@December#Date*] to sort through vast amounts of video collected by surveillance drones, a flood of data that's overwhelming human analysts. [@Schmidt#Person*] made the point during his remarks that the [@Defense Department#Org*] wastes the talents of many of its highly trained personnel watching video screens and typing information from one system into another. That is exactly the sort of important, but mundane and mind-deadening work that [@AI#ai_tec*]s can take over from humans, [@Schmidt#Person*] said. Finally, [@Schmidt#Person*], one of the few top software or social media executives to openly work with the [@Pentagon#Org*] as chairman of its [@Defense Innovation Advisory Board#Org*], also made the point that the [@United States#Gpe*] risks much by excluding talented immigrants from the country. "Shockingly, some of the very best people are in countries where we won't them into [@America#Gpe*]." [@Iranians#Gpe*], for example, are some of "the smartest and top computer scientists  in the world," he said. He'd love to hire many of them, but [@Trump#Person*] administration policies make this extremely difficult. "It's crazy not to let them in," [@Schmidt#Person*] said. The president today slammed the immigration laws that allowed the coward in [@New York#Gpe*] who killed people with his truck to enter the country. The person is from [@Uzbekistan#Gpe*], which, of course, isn't on the administration's list of countries whose citizens were effectively barred from the [@US#Gpe*] by [@Trump's September executive order#MISC*]. (The judiciary has, so far, barred the administration from executing the order.) As a reminder, the order targets [@Iran#Gpe*], [@Libya#Gpe*], [@Syria#Gpe*], [@Yemen#Gpe*], [@Somalia#Gpe*], [@Chad#Gpe*] and [@North Korea#Gpe*]. [@Chad#Gpe*], of course, had provided extensive help to the [@US#Gpe*] and allies in the fight against terrorism in [@Africa#Gpe*]. And who can count the number of [@North Koreans#Gpe*] streaming into the [@United States#Gpe*]?
