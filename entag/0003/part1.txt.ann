[@Artificial intelligence#ai_tec*] ([@AI#ai_tec*]), specifically the subfields [@machine learning#ai_tec*] ([@ML#ai_tec*]) and [@deep learning#ai_tec*] ([@DL#ai_tec*]), has within a decade moved from prototyping at research institutes and universities to industry and real-world ap- plication. Modern [$AI#ai_tec*] using [@DL-techniques#ai_tec*] has revolutionized the performance of traditional [@AI-applications#ai_product*] such as [@machine translation#ai_product*], [@QA-systems#ai_product*], and [@speech recognition#ai_product*]. The many advancements in this field has also turned other ingenious ideas into remarkable [$AI-applications#ai_product*] capable of image caption- ing , lip reading, voice imitation, video synthesis, continuous control, etc. These results suggest that a machine capable of programming itself has the potential to: 1) improve efficiency with respect the development costs of both software and hardware, 2) perform specific tasks at a superhuman level, 3) provide creative solutions to problems not previously considered by humans, and 4) provide objective and fair decisions where humans are known for being subjective, biased, unfair, corrupt, etc. In a military context, the potential for [$AI#ai_tec*] is present in all domains (i.e. land, sea, air, space and informa- tion) and all levels of warfare (i.e. political, strategic, operational and tactical). For instance, at the political and strategical levels, [$AI#ai_tec*] can be used to destabilize an opponent by producing and publishing massive quan- tities of fake information. In this case, [$AI#ai_tec*] will most likely also be the best candidate to defend against such attacks. At the tactical level, [$AI#ai_tec*] can improve partly autonomous control in [@unmanned systems#ai_product*] so that human operators can operate [$unmanned systems#ai_product*] more efficiently to, ultimately, increase battlefield impact. However, as we will point out in this work, there are several key challenges that could potentially slow down or otherwise limit the use of modern [$AI#ai_tec*] in military applications. Insufficient transparency and interpretability of [@ML-models#ai_tec*]. As an example, using [$DL#ai_tec*] to model the control of a [@self-driving car#ai_product*] using a [@deep neural network#ai_tec*] ([@DNN#ai_tec*]) requires several hundreds of thousands of parameters. Clearly such a complex program can not easily be interpreted. Even models generated using alternative [@ML-algorithms#ai_tec*] where the model can be graphically visualized, such as parser trees or decision trees, are hard if not impossible to interpret even when applied to toy- problems. A related and perhaps even more important challenge is the ability, or in this case inability, for the [@AI-system#ai_product*] to explain its reasoning to the decision maker or human operator. Models developed using [$ML#ai_tec*] are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. For instance, a [$DL#ai_tec*]- based model can easily be deceived through manipulation of the input signal even if the model is unknown to the attacker. As an example, [@unmanned aerial vehicles#ai_product*] ([@UAVs#ai_product*]) using state-of-the-art [@object detection#ai_product*] can potentially be deceived by a carefully designed camouflage pattern on the ground. The main ingredient in any [@ML-application#ai_product*] is data from which the machines can learn and, ultimately, provide insight into. Military organizations are often good at collecting data for debriefing or recon- struction purposes. However, there is no guarantee that the same data can be used successfully for [$ML#ai_tec*]. As a result, military organizations may have to adapt their data collection processes to take full advantage of modern [@AI-techniques#ai_tec*], such as [$DL#ai_tec*]. The purpose of this paper is to highlight possibilities and major challenges for [$AI#ai_tec*] in military appli- cations. Section 2 provides a brief introduction to [$DL#ai_tec*], which is the main [@AI-technique#ai_tec*] of interest in this paper. Section 3 provides a few examples of military [$AI-applications#ai_product*]. Section 4 describes key challenges associated with [$AI#ai_tec*] in the military domain, as well as techniques that can be used to partially address these challenges. Conclusions are presented in Section 5.
