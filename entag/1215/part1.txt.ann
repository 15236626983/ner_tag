[@WASHINGTON#Gpe*] – The [@Defense Department#Org*] has formally ordered the creation of a new hub for [@artificial intelligence#ai_tec*] research with [@Dana Deasy#Person*], the Pentagon's new chief information officer, taking the lead. Deputy Secretary of Defense [@Patrick Shanahan#Person*] ordered the move in a [@June 27#Date*] memo. The [@Pentagon#Org*]'s goal is to launch a series of [@AI#ai_tec*] projects known as [@National Mission Initiatives#ai_program*] within 90 days – as well as taking over the controversial [@Project Maven#ai_program*].  The office will be known as the [@Joint Artificial Intelligence Center#Org*] ([@JAIC#Org*]), with the goal of enabling "teams across [@DoD#Org*] to swiftly deliver new [@AI#ai_tec*]-enabled capabilities and effectively experiment with new operating concepts in support of [@DoD#Org*]'s military missions and business functions," according to [@DoD#Org*] spokeswoman Lt. Col. [@Michelle Baldanza#Person*]. Put another way, the group will have the "overarching goal of accelerating the delivery of [@AI#ai_tec*]-enabled capabilities, scaling the Department-wide impact of [@AI#ai_tec*], and synchronizing [@DoD#Org*] [@AI#ai_tec*] activities to expand [@Joint Force#Org*] advantages," according to a copy of the memo posted by [@Breaking Defense#Org*]. "This effort is a Department priority. Speed and security are of the essence," [@Shanahan#Person*] wrote. "I expect all offices and personnel to provide all reasonable support necessary to make rapid enterprise-wide [@AI#ai_tec*] adoption a reality." Deputy Secretary of Defense [@Patrick M. Shanahan#Person*] directed the [@DoD#Org*] Chief Information Officer to standup the [@Joint Artificial Intelligence Center#Org*] ([@JAIC#Org*]) in order to enable teams across [@DoD#Org*] to swiftly deliver new [@AI#ai_tec*]-enabled capabilities and effectively experiment with new operating concepts in support of [@DoD#Org*]'s military missions and business functions. The [@JAIC#Org*] marks the second major initiative [@Pentagon#Org*] leaders handed over to [@Deasy#Person*], a former CIO with [@JPMorgan Chase#Org*] who has only been at the [@Pentagon#Org*] for a few weeks. [@Deasy#Person*] also is in charge of managing the department's [@JEDI#ai_program*] cloud computing contract. The idea of standing up an [@AI#ai_tec*] center was first confirmed by Secretary of Defense [@Jim Mattis#Person*] on [@April 12#Date*], but it has been championed by the [@Defense Innovation Board#Org*], a group of outside experts ho advice the secretary on potential updates to how the [@Pentagon#Org*] handles evolving technologies. According to [@Michael Griffin#Person*], the head of [@Pentagon#Org*] research and engineering, the department counts 592 projects as having some form of [@AI#ai_tec*] in them. However, [@Griffin#Person*] said in [@April 18#Date*] testimony that he did not believe every one of those projects makes sense to roll into some sort of [@AI#ai_tec*] hub. That concern appears to be reflected in [@Shanahan#Person*]'s memo, which orders that any [@AI#ai_tec*] project with a budget of $15 million or more should be coordinated with the services in order to ensure "[@DoD#Org*] is creating Department-wide advantages." In terms of budget, [@Shanahan#Person*] ordered the [@Pentagon#Org*]'s comptroller to find options for funding during the current fiscal year, but the major focus is on driving resources for fiscal year [@2019#Date*] and beyond. Given the support for [@artificial intelligence#ai_tec*] research on the Hill, it is likely the final version of the [@National Defense Authorization Act for FY19#MISC*] will include some funding for the new office. The movement of [@Project Maven#ai_program*] to the [@JAIC#Org*] is notable. A [@DoD#Org*] initiative to accelerate the integration of [@big data#ai_tec*] and [@machine learning#ai_tec*], largely drawing on video feeds from [@unmanned systems#ai_product*], [@Maven#ai_program*] in the last month has become a poster child for the clash of cultures between the defense department and [@Silicon Valley#Org*]. [@Google#Org*] was working hand-in-hand with the [@Pentagon#Org*] on the project, until a backlash from the company's employees, who argued in an open letter signed by more than 3,000 workers that it did not want to "build warfare technology." Moving the program to the [@JAIC#Org*] may be an attempt to keep the project underway without [@Google#Org*]'s participation.
