The [@U.S. government#Org*], long a proponent of advancing technology for military purposes, sees [@artificial intelligence#ai_tec*] as key to the next generation of fighting tools.  Several recent investments and [@Pentagon#Org*] initiatives show that military leaders are concerned about keeping up with – and ahead of – [@China#Gpe*] and [@Russia#Gpe*], two countries that have made big gains in developing [@artificial-intelligence#ai_tec*] systems. [@AI#ai_tec*]-powered weapons include [@target recognition systems#ai_product*], weapons guided by [@AI#ai_tec*], and [@cyberattack#MISC*] and [@cyberdefense#MISC*] software that runs without human intervention. The [@U.S.#Gpe*] defense community is coming to understand that [@AI#ai_tec*] will significantly transform, if not completely reinvent, the world's military power balance. The concern is more than military. As [@Chinese#Gpe*] and [@Russian#Gpe*] technologies become more sophisticated, they threaten [@U.S.#Gpe*] domination of technological innovation and development, as well as global economic power and influence. [@Military#Org*] leaders see the threat to [@U.S.#Gpe*] technological leadership coming from two main sources: a rising and ambitious [@China#Gpe*] and a mischievous and declining [@Russia#Gpe*]. Taken together, these forces challenge global stability. A [@2018#Date*] [@Pentagon#Org*] report noted that technological developments could change the types of threats facing the [@U.S.#Gpe*], which might include space-based weapons, long-range ballistic missiles and [@cyberweapons#MISC*]. A [@February 2019#Date*] analysis warned that [@China#Gpe*]'s investments in its military's [@AI#ai_tec*] systems – in particular, those supporting robotics, autonomy, precision munitions and cyber warfare – threaten to overtake the [@United States#Gpe*]. [@Chinese government#Org*] agencies are working closely with the country's civilian businesses to keep on top of fast-changing technological developments. In addition, some [@Chinese#Gpe*] and [@Russian#Gpe*] projects have developed military [@AI#ai_tec*] systems specifically aimed at what they perceive as [@U.S.#Gpe*] technological weaknesses. For instance, swarms of armed [@AI-enhanced drones#ai_product*] might locate and attack the secure computer systems countries rely on to control and launch their nuclear weapons. So far the [@Pentagon#Org*]'s actions have been largely bureaucratic, rather than concrete. It has released a [@Defense Department#Org*]-wide strategy document that articulates broad principles for the development and use of [@AI#ai_tec*] in future warfare. The military has established a [@Joint Artificial Intelligence Center#Org*], which is tasked with accelerating the delivery and adoption of [@AI#ai_tec*]. But projects with names like "[@the Third Offset#ai_program*]," "[@Project Maven#ai_program*]" and the "[@AI Next Campaign#ai_program*]" have minimal funding. Leaders have released few details about what they will actually do. The [@Pentagon#Org*] has also established the [@Defense Innovation Unit#Org*], with permission to circumvent the cumbersome military purchasing process, to coordinate with [@Silicon Valley#Org*] and bring new technologies into military use relatively quickly. That unit has sparked discussions about the potential for the [@Chinese military#Org*] to acquire and use [@U.S.#Gpe*]-designed technologies, which led to [@U.S.#Gpe*] bans on doing business with many [@Chinese technology firms#Org*]. Many experts consider it possible for [@China#Gpe*] to surpass the [@U.S.#Gpe*] in the development and use of [@AI#ai_tec*]. However, [@China#Gpe*] trails the [@U.S.#Gpe*] in several ways. The [@United States#Gpe*] has the world's largest intelligence budget; the most popular hardware, software and technology companies; and the most advanced [@cyberwarfare#MISC*] capabilities, both offensive and defensive. I and other experts expect these advantages to preserve [@U.S.#Gpe*] technological leadership for now, at least – but perhaps not forever.
