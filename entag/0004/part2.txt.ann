Much of the current progress in the field has been in specialized, well-defined tasks often driven by [@statistical ML#ai_tec*], such as [@classification#ai_product*], [@recognition#ai_product*], and [@regression#ai_product*] (i.e., “[@narrow AI systems#ai_tec*]”). Surveys of the field have noted that long-term investments in fundamental research are needed to continue building on these advances in [@ML#ai_tec*]. Further, parallel sustained efforts are required to fully realize the vision of “[@general-purpose AI#ai_tec*]”—systems that exhibit the flexibility and versatility of human intelligence in a broad range of cognitive domains.
