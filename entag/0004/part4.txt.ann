[@AI#ai_tec*] research investments are needed in areas with potential long-term payoffs. While an important component of long-term research is incremental research with predictable outcomes, long-term sustained investments in high-risk research can lead to high-reward payoffs. These payoffs can be seen in [@5 years#Date*], [@10 years#Date*], or more. A [@2012#Date*] [@National Research Council#Org*] report emphasizes the critical role of Federal investments in long-term research, noting “the long, unpredictable incubation period—requiring steady work and funding—between initial exploration and commercial deployment.” 33 It further notes that “the time from first concept to successful market is often measured in decades.” Well-documented examples of sustained fundamental research efforts that led to high-reward payoffs include the World Wide Web and[@ deep learning#ai_tec*]. In both cases, the basic foundations began in the [@1960s#Date*]; it was only after [@30+ years#Date*] of continued research efforts that these ideas materialized into the transformative technologies witnessed today in many categories of [$AI#ai_tec*].
