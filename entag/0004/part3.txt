Emphasis is needed on the development of further ML capabilities to interactively and persistently learn, the connection between perception and attention, and the incorporation of learned models into comprehensive reasoning architectures. 30 Beyond ML, critical research is also needed in other core areas of AI, including in commonsense reasoning and problem solving, probabilistic reasoning, combinatorial optimization, knowledge representation, planning and scheduling, natural language processing, decision making, and human-machine interaction. Advances in these areas will in turn enable collaborative robotics and shared and fully autonomous systems (see Strategy 2). The grand challenge of understanding human intelligence requires significant investments in shared resources and infrastructure. 25 Broad consensus exists for foundational investments in drivers of ML and AI as well, including data provenance and quality, novel software and hardware paradigms and platforms, and the security of AI systems. 31,32 For example, as AI software performs increasingly complex functions in all aspects of daily life and all sectors of the economy, existing software development paradigms will need to evolve to meet software productivity, quality, and sustainability requirements. Recent Federal investments have prioritized these areas of fundamental ML and AI research (see sidebar) as well as the use of ML and AI across numerous application sectors, including defense, security, energy, transportation, health, agriculture, and telecommunications. Ultimately, AI technologies are critical for addressing a range of long-term challenges, such as constructing advanced healthcare systems, a robust intelligent transportation system, and resilient energy and telecommunication networks.
