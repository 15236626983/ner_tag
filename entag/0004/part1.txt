Since the release of the 2016 National AI R&D Strategic Plan, powerful new capabilities, primarily ML applications to well-defined tasks, have continued to emerge. These capabilities have demonstrated impacts in a diverse array of applications, such as classifying genetic sequences, 20,21 managing limited wireless spectrum resources, 22 interpreting medical images, 23 and grading cancers. 24 These rapid advances required decades of research for the technologies and applications to mature. 25 To maintain this progress in ML to achieve advancements in other areas of AI, and to strive toward the long-term goal of general-purpose AI, the Federal Government must continue to foster long-term, fundamental research in ML and AI. This research will give rise to transformational technologies and, in turn, breakthroughs across all sectors of society.
