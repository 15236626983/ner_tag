Much of the current progress in the field has been in specialized, well-defined tasks often driven by statistical ML, such as classification, recognition, and regression (i.e., “narrow AI systems”). Surveys of the field have noted that long-term investments in fundamental research are needed to continue building on these advances in ML. Further, parallel sustained efforts are required to fully realize the vision of “general-purpose AI”—systems that exhibit the flexibility and versatility of human intelligence in a broad range of cognitive domains.
