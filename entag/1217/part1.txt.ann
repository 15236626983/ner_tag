[@Google#Org*] wants out of [@Maven#ai_program*] — the program that relies on artificial intelligence to interpret video images. I for one am not the least bit surprised. By way of background: In early [@April#Date*], The [@New York Times#Org*] reported 3,100 [@Google#Org*] employees signed a letter asking the company to pull out of the program, which would use [@Google#Org*]'s [@AI#ai_tec*] technology to help identify objects in drone video. Those objects could become targets, employees argued, and they didn't want their talents being used or potentially used as a weapon of war. Wanting to avoid a mass exodus, [@Google#Org*] told employees earlier this month that it would not renew the contract with the [@Pentagon#Org*] after the current deal expires next year. My colleague [@Mike Gruss#Person*] described the letter in his own editorial for sister publication [@C4ISRNET#Org*] as an act of pacifism. He also argued that it could be viewed as a subtle attack on the outreach to the tech community. "[@Pentagon#Org*] leaders have not made a convincing case as to why their dollars and their vision to change the world are any more altruistic than the next guy with billion-dollar pockets," he said. The [@Pentagon#Org*] wants to move faster and is looking to [@Silicon Valley#Org*] to do so, but [@Silicon Valley#Org*] can't quite sync up culturally with the ultimate goals of the [@Pentagon#Org*], he added. It's a lost cause. There is some truth in that argument. I'd take it one step further and say not only does [@Silicon Valley#Org*] have a hard time getting on the same page culturally with [@Washington#Gpe*] — it doesn't particularly feel the need to do so. The returns on government contracts are lower than commercial, and there is no shortage of opportunities in their own sandbox. I have argued before that there is simply not enough incentive for such companies to bother. But if a more pacifist culture is truly partially to blame for the [@Washington#Gpe*]-tech disconnect, why aren't [@Amazon#Org*] and [@Microsoft#Org*] employees raising hell over the [@JEDI#ai_program*] cloud contract, considering it in theory will support battlefield operations? One could perhaps argue [@JEDI#ai_program*] is a simple enterprise IT contract, less directly linked to warfare intelligence. But if the [@Pentagon#Org*] realizes the full vision of [@JEDI#ai_program*], all of the drone imagery could ultimately live in that cloud infrastructure, and all the transactions of data sharing for the sake of intelligence would in whole or in part reside there. It would be a hub of intelligence gathering. So really, is [@Maven#ai_program*] that much different? And could we not argue that [@Maven#ai_program*] supports not a weapon of war but rather situational awareness — providing the [@Pentagon#Org*] with more granular data to ensure it doesn't make frivolous decisions when it comes to strikes? Yes, the decision to pull out of [@Maven#ai_program*] does reflect a clash of cultures. But in this particular case, [@Google#Org*]'s employees got ahead of the marketing team with this letter — owning the message and preventing the company or the [@Pentagon#Org*] from painting a rosier picture on a contract that could be interpreted in any number of ways. No surprise — the [@Pentagon#Org*] doesn't speak about such things, and [@Google#Org*] probably followed its lead, hoping nobody would make a fuss. But if these two communities are ever to coexist, there just may need to be a little more handholding. And let's not forget one other thing: [@Google#Org*] is not [@Amazon#Org*]. [@Amazon#Org*] may be a technological marvel, but it's still ultimately perceived as an e-commerce site. Politics don't typically get in the way of its empire. [@Google#Org*] — much like Facebook and other social media applications — is in the business of data analytics. Often people's data for that matter. And that makes everything they do political. Just ask [@Mark Zuckerberg#Person*].
