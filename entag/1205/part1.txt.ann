The [@Sierra Nevada Corporation#Org*] has been selected for the final phase of the [@Defense Advanced Research Agency#Org*]'s [@Gremlins program#ai_program*], which aims to launch and recover reusable drone swarms using manned airborne aircraft far outside of enemy ranges, according to a [@May 9#Date*] press release from the company. [@Sierra Nevada Corporation#Org*] ([@SNC#Org*]) will provide [@Gremlin Air Vehicles#ai_product*] with an [@autonomous docking system#ai_product*], allowing the drones to be retrieved by a [@C-130 transport aircraft#MISC*] they complete their mission. They would then be carried home and prepared for reuse within 24 hours. [@SNC#Org*] was selected for the program's Phase 3 team by [@Dynetics#Org*], an aeronautics company. [@Dynetics#Org*] is developing a capture device to be deployed below and away from a [@C-130#MISC*] and then docked to the [@Gremlin vehicles#ai_product*], so they can be raised and returned to the transport aircraft mid-flight. The third and final phase of the program will serve as an opportunity to demonstrate the [@Gremlin technology#ai_tec*] developed during the two prior competitive phases, which narrowed competition down from four teams to one. "[@SNC#Org*]'s past accomplishments with [@autonomous refueling#ai_tec*] and [@precision navigation#ai_tec*] were a perfect fit for what [@Dynetics#Org*] planned to accomplish on the [@Gremlins program#ai_program*]," said [@Greg Cox#Person*], senior vice president of business development and technology for [@SNC#Org*]'s electronic and information systems business area. The multivehicle control services and user interface for the vehicles will be provided by a third team member, [@Kutta Technology#Org*], also an [@SNC#Org*] subsidiary. [@Kutta#Org*]'s role is to "provide a control station with safe, intuitive work flows for controlling multiple [[@Gremlin air vehicles#ai_product*]] simultaneously from launch to recovery." Earlier this month [@DARPA#Org*] announced they had successfully tested [@Gremlin technology#ai_tec*] during a flight test at [@Yuma Proving Ground#MISC*], keeping the program on path toward airborne launch and recovery of multiple drones by [@late 2019#Date*]. "Early flight tests have given us confidence we can meet our objective to recover four gremlins in 30 minutes," said [@Scott Wierzbanowski#Person*], program manager in [@DARPA#Org*]'s [@Tactical Technology Office#Org*]. [@DARPA#Org*] awarded [@Dynetics#Org*] a 21-month, $38.6 million contract for the third phase the [@Gremlin program#ai_program*] in [@April#Date*]. Other members of the team include [@Kratos Unmanned Aerial Systems#Org*], [@Moog#Org*], [@Airborne Systems#Org*], [@Systima#Org*], [@Applied Systems Engineering#Org*], Inc., and [@International Air Response#Org*].
