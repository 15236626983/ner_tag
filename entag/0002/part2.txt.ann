Currently, [@AI#ai_tec*] technologies are highly tailored to particular applications or tasks, known as [@narrow (or weak) AI#ai_tec*]. In contrast, [@general (or strong) AI#ai_tec*] refers to intelligent behavior across a range of cognitive tasks, a capability which is unlikely to occur for decades, according to most analysts. Some researchers also use the term “[@augmented intelligence#ai_tec*]” to capture [$AI#ai_tec*]’s various applications in physical and connected systems, such as [@robotics#ai_product*] and the [@Internet of Things#ai_product*], and to focus on using [$AI#ai_tec*] technologies to enhance human activities rather than to replace them. In describing the course of [$AI#ai_tec*] development, the [@Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency#Org*] ([@DARPA#Org*]) has identified three “waves.” The first wave focused on handcrafted knowledge that allowed for system-enabled reasoning in limited situations, though lacking the ability to learn or address uncertainty, as with many rule-based systems from the [@1980s#Date*]. The second wave, from approximately the [@2000s#Date*] to the [@present#Date*], has focused on advances in [@neural networks#ai_tec*] and [@machine learning#ai_tec*] (e.g., [@image recognition#ai_tec*], [@language translation#ai_tec*]) using statistical models and big data sets. The third wave will focus on contextual adaptation—learning and reasoning as the system encounters new tasks—moving towards [@general AI#ai_tec*]. Among researchers and developers, the outlook on [$AI#ai_tec*] development and application across sectors is widely optimistic, though challenges exist. Such challenges are both technical (e.g., availability of datasets to train [@AI systems#ai_product*], and understanding and removing biases from [@AI-based#ai_tec*] decisions) and societal (e.g., addressing potential workforce shifts, privacy, security, and ethical use). In [@recent years#Date*], the private sector has been increasing research and development (R&D) investments and hiring in [$AI#ai_tec*], particularly at large technology companies such as [@Amazon#Org*], [@Facebook#Org*], [@Google#Org*], [@IBM#Org*], and [@Microsoft#Org*]. Large companies are also acquiring [$AI#ai_tec*] startups and launching venture funds to support startups. These and other technology companies, along with the [@AAAI#Org*]—a nonprofit scientific society—have formed the [@Partnership on AI#Org*], which aims to create best practices, educate the public, and serve as a platform for discussing [$AI#ai_tec*] technologies and societal impacts. Automotive and ride-sharing companies, such as [@Toyota#Org*] and [@Uber#Org*], have also announced large investments in [$AI#ai_tec*] research, as well as partnerships with university scientists and engineers. For example, the [@Toyota Research Institute#Org*] includes experts from [@Stanford#Org*]’s [@AI Laboratory#Org*] and [@Massachusetts Institute of Technology#Org*]’s [@Computer Science and AI Laboratory#Org*].
