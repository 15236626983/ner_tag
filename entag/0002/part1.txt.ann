Though definitions vary, [@AI#ai_tec*] can generally be thought of as computerized systems that work and react in ways commonly thought to require intelligence, such as solving complex problems in real-world situations. According to the [@Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence#Org*] ([@AAAI#Org*]), researchers broadly seek to understand “the mechanisms underlying thought and intelligent behavior and their embodiment in machines.” The field of [$AI#ai_tec*] encompasses many methodologies and areas of emphasis, such as [@machine learning#ai_tec*] ([@ML#ai_tec*]), [@deep learning#ai_tec*], [@neural networks#ai_tec*], [@robotics#ai_tec*], [@machine/computer vision#ai_tec*] ([@image processing#ai_tec*]), and [@natural language processing#ai_tec*]. Advances in these areas, in information processing and hardware technology generally, and in the availability of large-scale data sets, have all contributed to recent progress in [$AI#ai_tec*]. [@Applications of AI#ai_product*] are found in everyday technologies, such as video games, web searching, spam filtering, and [@voice recognition#ai_product*] (e.g., [@Apple#Org*]’s [@Siri#ai_product*]). Notable [@AI systems#ai_product*] have beaten human champions of games like chess, Go, and Jeopardy!. More broadly, [$AI#ai_tec*] has applications across a variety of sectors, including the following examples: Transportation—[@self-driving cars#ai_product*], [@adaptive traffic management#ai_product*] to reduce wait times and emissions; Health care—diagnostics and [@targeted treatments#ai_product*]; Education—[@digital tutors#ai_product*]; Agriculture—[@soil moisture monitoring#ai_product*] and [@targeted crop watering#ai_product*]; Finance—early [@detection of unusual market manipulation and anomalous trading#ai_product*]; Law—[@machine analysis#ai_product*] of law case history; Manufacturing—[@automated delivery#ai_product*], improved worker safety and productivity via [@machine-human teaming#ai_tec*]; Cybersecurity—[@autonomous detection and decisionmaking#ai_product*] to improve reaction times to threats; Defense—[@autonomous and semi-autonomous weapons systems#ai_product*]; Space exploration—[@spacecraft and rover autonomy#ai_product*]; and “[$AI#ai_tec*] for the social good”—using [$AI#ai_tec*] to address widespread societal challenges, e.g., to [@monitor wildlife populations#ai_product*], [@target anti-poaching efforts#ai_product*], and [@identify intervention zones#ai_product*] for poverty reduction efforts.
