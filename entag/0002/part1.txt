Though definitions vary, AI can generally be thought of as computerized systems that work and react in ways commonly thought to require intelligence, such as solving complex problems in real-world situations. According to the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), researchers broadly seek to understand “the mechanisms underlying thought and intelligent behavior and their embodiment in machines.” The field of AI encompasses many methodologies and areas of emphasis, such as machine learning (ML), deep learning, neural networks, robotics, machine/computer vision (image processing), and natural language processing. Advances in these areas, in information processing and hardware technology generally, and in the availability of large-scale data sets, have all contributed to recent progress in AI. Applications of AI are found in everyday technologies, such as video games, web searching, spam filtering, and voice recognition (e.g., Apple’s Siri). Notable AI systems have beaten human champions of games like chess, Go, and Jeopardy!. More broadly, AI has applications across a variety of sectors, including the following examples: Transportation—self-driving cars, adaptive traffic management to reduce wait times and emissions; Health care—diagnostics and targeted treatments; Education—digital tutors; Agriculture—soil moisture monitoring and targeted crop watering; Finance—early detection of unusual market manipulation and anomalous trading; Law—machine analysis of law case history; Manufacturing—automated delivery, improved worker safety and productivity via machine-human teaming; Cybersecurity—autonomous detection and decisionmaking to improve reaction times to threats; Defense—autonomous and semi-autonomous weapons systems; Space exploration—spacecraft and rover autonomy; and “AI for the social good”—using AI to address widespread societal challenges, e.g., to monitor wildlife populations, target anti-poaching efforts, and identify intervention zones for poverty reduction efforts.
