[@DOD#Org*] is considering a number of diverse applications for [@AI#ai_tec*]. Currently, [@AI#ai_tec*] R&D is being left to the discretion of research organizations in the individual services, as well as to [@DARPA#Org*] and the [@Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Agency#Org*] ([@IARPA#Org*]). However, [@DOD#Org*] components are currently required to coordinate with the [@JAIC#Org*] regarding any planned [@AI#ai_tec*] initiatives costing more than $15 million annually. In addition, the [@JAIC#Org*] has been tasked with overseeing the [@National Mission Initiatives#Org*], projects that will leverage [@AI#ai_tec*] to address pressing operational challenges. [@The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering#Org*], which oversaw the development of [$DOD#Org*]’s [@AI Strategy#ai_program*], will continue to support [$AI#ai_tec*] development and delivery. [@The Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team#ai_program*], also known as [@Project Maven#ai_program*], has previously been a focal point for [$DOD#Org*] [$AI#ai_tec*] integration and will transition from the [@Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence#Org*] to the [$JAIC#Org*], where it will become the first of the [$JAIC#Org*]’s [@National Mission Initiatives#ai_program*]. [$Project Maven#ai_program*] was launched in [@April 2017#Date*] and charged with rapidly incorporating [$AI#ai_tec*] into existing [$DOD#Org*] systems to demonstrate the technology’s potential. [$Project Maven#ai_program*]’s inaugural director stated, “[@Maven#ai_program*] is designed to be that pilot project, that pathfinder, that spark that kindles the flame for[@ artificial intelligence#ai_tec*] across the department.” [$AI#ai_tec*] is also being incorporated into a number of other intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance applications, as well as in logistics, cyberspace operations, information operations, command and control, [@semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles#ai_product*], and lethal [@autonomous weapon systems#ai_product*]. [$AI#ai_tec*] is expected to be particularly useful in intelligence due to the large data sets available for analysis. For example, [@Project Mave#ai_program*]’s first phase involves [@automating intelligence processing#ai_product*] in support of the counter-[@ISIL#Gpe*] campaign. Specifically, the [$Project Maven#ai_program*] team is incorporating [@computer vision#ai_product*] and [@machine learning#ai_product*] algorithms into intelligence collection cells that would comb through footage from [@uninhabited aerial vehicles#ai_product*] and automatically identify hostile activity for targeting. In this capacity, [$AI#ai_tec*] is intended to automate the work of human analysts who currently spend hours sifting through videos for actionable information, potentially freeing analysts to make more efficient and timely decisions based on the data. The intelligence community also has a number of publicly acknowledged [@AI#ai_tec*] research projects in progress. The [@Central Intelligence Agency#Org*] alone has around projects in development that leverage [$AI#ai_tec*] in some capacity to accomplish tasks such as [@image recognition#ai_tec*] and [@predictive analytics#ai_tec*]. [$IARPA#Org*] is sponsoring several [$AI#ai_tec*] research projects intended to produce other analytic tools within the [@next four to five years#Date*]. Some examples include developing algorithms for multilingual [@speech recognition and translation#ai_tec*] in noisy environments, [@geo-locating images#ai_tec*] without the associated metadata, fusing 2-D images to create 3-D models, and building tools to infer a building’s function based on [@pattern-of-life analysis#ai_tec*]. [$AI#ai_tec*] may have future utility in the field of military logistics. The [@Air Force#Org*], for example, is beginning to use [$AI#ai_tec*] for [@predictive aircraft maintenance#ai_product*]. Instead of making repairs when an aircraft breaks or in accordance with standardized fleet-wide maintenance schedules, the [$Air Force#Org*] is testing an [@AI-enabled#ai_tec*] approach that tailors maintenance schedules to the needs of individual aircraft. This approach, currently used by the F-35’s [@Autonomic Logistics Information System#ai_product*], extracts real-time sensor data embedded in the aircraft’s engines and other onboard systems and feeds the data into a [@predictive algorithm#ai_tec*] to determine when technicians need to inspect the aircraft or replace parts. Similarly, the [@Army#Org*]’s [@Logistics Support Activity#Org*] ([@LOGSA#Org*]) has contracted [@IBM#Org*]’s [@Watson#ai_product*] (the same [$AI#ai_tec*] software that defeated two Jeopardy champions) to develop tailored maintenance schedules for the Stryker fleet based on information pulled from the 17 sensors installed on each vehicle. In [@September 2017#Date*], [$LOGSA#Org*] began a second project that will use [$Watson#ai_product*] to analyze shipping flows for repair parts distribution, attempting to determine the most time- and cost- efficient means to deliver supplies. This task is currently done by human analysts, who have saved the [$Army#Org*] around $100 million a year by analyzing just 10% of shipping requests; with [$Watson#ai_product*], the [$Army#Org*] will have the ability to analyze 100% of shipping requests, potentially generating even greater cost savings in a shorter period of time.
