The U.S. military is seeking to exploit AI’s analytic potential in the area of command and control. The Air Force is developing a system for Multi-Domain Command and Control (MDC2), which aims to centralize planning and execution of air-, space-, cyberspace-, sea-, and land-based operations. In the immediate future, AI may be used to fuse data from sensors in all of these domains to create a single source of information, also known as a “common operating picture,” for decisionmakers. 73 Currently, information available to decisionmakers comes in diverse formats from multiple platforms, often with redundancies or unresolved discrepancies. An AI-enabled common operating picture would theoretically combine this information into one display, providing a comprehensive picture of friendly and enemy forces, and automatically resolving variances from input data. Such a system could eventually enable “any sensor to provide data to any shooter from any service, ally, or partner … to achieve effects against any target.” 74 Although MDC2 is still in a concept development phase, the Air Force is working with Lockheed Martin, Harris, and several AI start-ups to develop the capability. A series of war-games in 2018 sought to refine requirements for this project. 75 Similarly, DARPA’s Mosaic Warfare program seeks to leverage AI to coordinate autonomous forces and dynamically generate multidomain command and control nodes. 76 Future AI systems may be used to identify communications links cut by an adversary and find alternative means of distributing information. As the complexity of AI systems matures, AI algorithms may also be capable of providing commanders with a menu of viable courses of action based on real-time analysis of the battle-space, in turn enabling faster adaptation to complex events. 77 In the long run, many analysts believe this area of AI development could be particularly consequential, with the potential to improve the quality and speed of wartime decisionmaking.
