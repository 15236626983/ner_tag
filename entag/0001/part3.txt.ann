The [@U.S.#Gpe*] military is seeking to exploit [@AI#ai_tec*]’s analytic potential in the area of command and control. The [@Air Force#Org*] is developing a system for [@Multi-Domain Command and Control#ai_product*] ([@MDC2#ai_product*]), which aims to centralize planning and execution of air-, space-, cyberspace-, sea-, and land-based operations. In the immediate future, [$AI#ai_tec*] may be used to fuse data from sensors in all of these domains to create a single source of information, also known as a “common operating picture,” for decisionmakers. Currently, information available to decisionmakers comes in diverse formats from multiple platforms, often with redundancies or unresolved discrepancies. An [@AI-enabled#ai_tec*] common operating picture would theoretically combine this information into one display, providing a comprehensive picture of friendly and enemy forces, and automatically resolving variances from input data. Such a system could eventually enable “any sensor to provide data to any shooter from any service, ally, or partner … to achieve effects against any target.” Although [$MDC2#ai_product*] is still in a concept development phase, the [$Air Force#Org*] is working with [@Lockheed Martin#Org*], [@Harris#Org*], and several [$AI#ai_tec*] start-ups to develop the capability. A series of war-games in [@2018#Date*] sought to refine requirements for this project. Similarly, [@DARPA#Org*]’s [@Mosaic Warfare#ai_program*] program seeks to leverage [$AI#ai_tec*] to coordinate [@autonomous forces#ai_product*] and dynamically generate multidomain command and control nodes. Future [$AI#ai_tec*] systems may be used to identify communications links cut by an adversary and find alternative means of distributing information. As the complexity of [$AI#ai_tec*] systems matures, [$AI#ai_tec*] algorithms may also be capable of providing commanders with a menu of viable courses of action based on real-time analysis of the battle-space, in turn enabling faster adaptation to complex events. In the long run, many analysts believe this area of [$AI#ai_tec*] development could be particularly consequential, with the potential to improve the quality and speed of wartime decisionmaking.
