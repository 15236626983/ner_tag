Some reports indicate that [@DOD#Org*] and the defense industry also face challenges when it comes to recruiting and retaining personnel with expertise in [@AI#ai_tec*] due to research funding and salaries that significantly lag behind those of commercial companies. Other reports suggest that such challenges stem from quality-of-life factors, as well as from a belief among many technology workers that “they can achieve large-scale change faster and better outside the government than within it.” This sentiment echoes the findings of the [@National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence#Org*], which notes that “[$AI#ai_tec*] experts would be willing to serve in government if officials could create a more compelling sense of purpose and a technical environment within government that would maximize their talents.” Regardless, observers note that if [$DOD#Org*] and defense industry are unable to recruit and retain the appropriate experts, military [@AI applications#ai_product*] could be delayed, “deficient, or lacking in appropriate safeguards and testing.” To address these challenges, the [@Obama Administration#Org*] launched the [@Defense Digital Service#ai_program*] in [@2015#Date*] as a means of recruiting private sector technology workers to serve in [$DOD#Org*] for one to two year assignments—a “tour of duty for nerds,” according to former director [@Chris Lynch#Person*]. Similarly, former Deputy Secretary of [@Defense#Org*] [@Bob Work#Person*] has proposed an “[@AI Training Corps#ai_program*],” in which [$DOD#Org*] “would pay for advanced technical education in exchange for [@two days a month#Date*] of training with government systems and [@two weeks a year#Date*] for major exercises.” Participants in the program could additionally be called to government service in the event of a national emergency. Other analysts have recommended the establishment of new military training and occupational specialties to cultivate [$AI#ai_tec*] talent, as well as the creation of government fellowships and accelerated promotion tracks to reward the most talented technology workers. An apparent cultural divide between [$DOD#Org*] and commercial technology companies may also present challenges for [$AI#ai_tec*] adoption. A recent survey of leadership in several top [@Silicon Valley#Loc*] companies found that nearly 80% of participants rated the commercial technology community’s relationship with [$DOD#Org*] as poor or very poor. This was due to a number of factors, including process challenges, perceptions of mutual distrust, and differences between [$DOD#Org*] and commercial incentive structures. Moreover, some companies are refusing to work with [$DOD#Org*] due to ethical concerns over the government’s use of [$AI#ai_tec*] in surveillance or weapon systems. Notably, [@Google#Org*] canceled existing government contracts for two robotics companies it acquired—[@Boston Dynamics#Org*] and [@Schaft#Org*]— and prohibited future government work for [@DeepMind#Org*], a [$Google#Org*]-acquired [$AI#ai_tec*] software startup. In [@May 2018#Date*], [$Google#Org*] employees successfully lobbied the company to withdraw from [@Project Maven#ai_program*] and refrain from further collaboration with [$DOD#Org*]. Other companies, however, have pledged to continue supporting [$DOD#Org*] contracts, with [@Amazon#Org*] CEO [@Jeff Bezos#Person*] noting that “if big tech companies are going to turn their back on the [@U.S.#Gpe*] [@Department of Defense#Org*], this country is going to be in trouble.” Cultural factors within the defense establishment itself may also impede [$AI#ai_tec*] integration. The integration of [$AI#ai_tec*] into existing systems alters standardized procedures and upends well-defined personnel roles. Members of [$Project Maven#ai_program*] have reported a resistance to [$AI#ai_tec*] integration because integration can be disruptive without always providing an immediately recognizable benefit. Deputy Director for [@CIA#Org*] technology development [@Dawn Meyerriecks#Person*] has also expressed concern about the willingness of senior leaders to accept [@AI-generated#ai_tec*] analysis, arguing that the defense establishment’s risk-averse culture may pose greater challenges to future competitiveness than the pace of adversary technology development. Finally, some analysts are concerned that [$DOD#Org*] will not capitalize on [$AI#ai_tec*]’s potential to produce game-changing warfighting benefits and will instead simply use [$AI#ai_tec*] to incrementally improve existing processes or reinforce current operational concepts. Furthermore, the services may reject certain [$AI applications#ai_product*] altogether if the technology threatens service-favored hardware or missions. Members of [@Congress#Org*] may explore the complex interaction of these factors as [$DOD#Org*] moves beyond the initial stages of [$AI#ai_tec*] adoption.
