From the Cold War era until recently, most major defense-related technologies, including nuclear technology, the Global Positioning System (GPS), and the internet, were first developed by government-directed programs before later spreading to the commercial sector. Indeed, [@DARPA#Org*]’s [@Strategic Computing Initiative#ai_program*] invested over $1 billion between [@1983#Date*] and [@1993#Date*] to develop the field of [@artificial intelligence#ai_tec*] for military applications, but the initiative was ultimately cancelled due to slower-than-anticipated progress. [@Today#Date*], commercial companies—sometimes building on past government-funded research—are leading [@AI#ai_tec*] development, with [@DOD#Org*] later adapting their tools for military applications. Noting this dynamic, one AI expert commented, “It is unusual to have a technology that is so strategically important being developed commercially by a relatively small number of companies.” In addition to the shift in funding sources, a number of challenges related to technology, process, personnel, and culture continue to impede the adoption of AI for military purposes. A wide variance exists in the ease of adaptability of commercial AI technology for military purposes. In some cases, the transition is relatively seamless. For example, the aforementioned [@aircraft maintenance algorithms#ai_tec*], many of which were initially developed by the commercial sector, will likely require only minor data adjustments to account for differences between aircraft types. In other circumstances, significant adjustments are required due to the differences between the structured civilian environments for which the technology was initially developed and more complex combat environments. For example, commercial semiautonomous vehicles have largely been developed in and for data-rich environments with reliable GPS positions, comprehensive terrain mapping, and up-to-date information on traffic and weather conditions obtained from other networked vehicles. In contrast, the military variant of such a vehicle would need to be able to operate in locations where map data are comparatively poor and in which GPS positioning may be inoperable due to adversary jamming. Moreover, [@semiautonomous or autonomous military ground vehicles#ai_product*] would likely need the ability to navigate off-road in rough terrain—a capability not inherent in most commercial vehicles. Standing DOD processes—including those related to standards of safety and performance, acquisitions, and intellectual property and data rights—present another challenge to the integration of military AI. Often, civilian and military standards of safety and performance are either not aligned or are not easily transferable. A failure rate deemed acceptable for a civilian [@AI application#ai_product*] may be well outside of tolerances in a combat environment—or vice versa. In addition, a recent research study concluded that unpredictable AI failure modes will be exacerbated in complex environments, such as those found in combat. Collectively, these factors may create another barrier for the smooth transfer of commercially developed AI technology to DOD. DOD may need to adjust its acquisitions process to account for rapidly evolving technologies such as AI. A [@2017#Date*] internal study of the process found that it takes an average of [@91 months#Date*] to move from the initial Analysis of Alternatives, defining the requirements for a system, to an Initial Operational Capability. In contrast, commercial companies typically execute an iterative development process for software systems like AI, delivering a product in [@six to nine months#Date*]. A [@Government Accountability Office#Org*] ([@GAO#Org*]) study of this issue surveyed 12 [@U.S.#Gpe*] commercial companies who choose not to do business with DOD, and all 12 cited the complexity of the defense acquisition process as a rationale for their decision. As a first step in addressing this, DOD has created a number of avenues for “rapid-acquisitions,” including the [@Strategic Capabilities Office#Org*], the [@Defense Innovation Unit#Org*], and [@Project Maven#ai_program*], in order to accelerate the acquisitions timeline and streamline cumbersome processes. Project Maven, for example, was established in [@April 2017#Date*]; by [@December#Date*], the team was fielding a commercially acquired prototype [@AI system#ai_product*] in combat. Although some analysts argue that these are promising developments, critics point out that the department must replicate the results achieved by Project Maven at scale and implement more comprehensive acquisitions reform. Commercial technology companies are also often reluctant to partner with DOD due to concerns about intellectual property and data rights. As an official interviewed for a 2017 GAO report on broader challenges in military acquisitions noted, intellectual property is the “life blood” of commercial technology companies, yet “DOD is putting increased pressure on companies to grant unlimited technical data and software rights or government purpose rights rather than limited or restricted rights.”
