SPARKS, Nev. ---- [@Sierra Nevada Corporation#Org*] ([@SNC#Org*]), has been selected to participate in Phase 3 of the [@Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency#Org*] ([@DARPA#Org*]) [@Gremlins program#ai_program*] as part of the Dynetics-led team. The [@Gremlins program#ai_program*] will develop the capability to launch groups of reusable [@Unmanned Aerial Systems#ai_product*] ([@UAS#ai_product*]) from manned aircraft while out of range of adversary defenses, enhancing the operational flexibility, safety and effectiveness of U.S. military air operations. When the Gremlins complete their mission, a C-130 transport aircraft aims to retrieve them in flight and return them to base for maintenance and preparation for additional missions, making the Gremlins a low-cost, repeatable solution. [@SNC#Org*] will provide the [@Gremlins Air Vehicle#ai_product*] ([@GAV#ai_product*]) [@Autonomous Docking System#ai_product*] ([@GADS#ai_product*]) precision navigation, guidance and control system elements essential to rendezvous and docking of the [@GAV#ai_product*] with the C-130 host aircraft. The basic architecture for the [@precision navigation capability#ai_tec*] ([@PNav#ai_tec*]) was initially developed for the [@Autonomous Aerial Refueling Demonstration#ai_program*] ([@AARD#ai_program*]) and [@UCAS-D#ai_program*] (X-47B) programs. The [@SNC#Org*] [@GADS#ai_product*] leverages much of the [@PNav#ai_tec*] technology to provide navigation, guidance and control for the [@GAV#ai_product*], enabling precision docking for recovery. The Dynetics solution involves deploying a towed, stabilized capture device below and away from the C-130. The [@GAV#ai_product*] is designed to dock with this device in a manner similar to an airborne refueling operation. [@Kutta Technology#Org*], an [@SNC#Org*] subsidiary, is providing the [@multi-vehicle control services#ai_product*] and [@user interface software#ai_product*] for Gremlins. The goal is to provide a control station with safe, intuitive work flows for controlling multiple [@GAV#ai_product*] simultaneously from launch to recovery. “Work on the [@Gremlins program#ai_program*] leverages Kutta’s previous experience with safe, supervised-autonomous vehicle control, coordinating multi-vehicle surveillance, and agent-based, [@manned-unmanned teaming#ai_tec*] ([@MUM-T#ai_tec*]),” said Kutta’s Chief Operating Officer, [@Doug Limbaugh#Person*]. During Phase 2, Kutta successfully implemented the control station prototypes for all operator workflows and established test plans and results to support airworthiness. The Phase 3 effort will refine these prototypes according to feedback generated during system integrations. “[@SNC#Org*]’s past accomplishments with [@autonomous refueling#ai_tec*] and [@precision navigation#ai_tec*] were a perfect fit for what Dynetics planned to accomplish on the [@Gremlins program#ai_program*]. Once the two companies came together to discuss how to leverage [@SNC#Org*]’s technology, both recognized an opportunity to help make the Dynetics team even more competitive,” said [@Greg Cox#Person*], senior vice president of business development and technology for [@SNC#Org*]’s Electronic and Information Systems business area. “I don’t believe anyone questioned that [@SNC#Org*] would be an outstanding partner to add to the team. I know we were certainly excited about joining a group as dedicated as Dynetics.”[@SNC#Org*] joined the Dynetics Gremlins team following completion of Phase 1 of the [@Gremlins program#ai_program*]. Prior to commencement of Phase 2, [@DARPA#Org*] down selected from four to two teams. Phase 2 served as an evaluation for final down select to a single team to demonstrate capabilities in Phase 3. “It doesn’t take much to recognize [@SNC#Org*] as an industry leader in [@precision navigation#ai_tec*]," said [@Mark Miller#Person*], Dynetics' [@Gremlins program#ai_program*] manager and vice president of Missile & Aviation Systems Division. "With the many challenges surrounding airborne recovery, Dynetics wanted the best expertise and experience for the navigation and docking operations, and that’s exactly what we get with [@SNC#Org*].”[@SNC#Org*] continues to be a leader in unmanned navigation and control and remains committed to developing [@autonomous technologies#ai_tec*]. The [@SNC#Org*] [@PNav#ai_tec*] technology is being considered for [@autonomous aeria refueling application#ai_tec*] while the [@Unmanned Common Automated Recovery System#ai_product*], Version 2 (UCARS V2) is currently fielded in support of Department of Defense [@UAS#ai_product*] operations. [@Sierra Nevada Corporation#Org*] ([@SNC#Org*]) is a trusted leader in solving the world’s toughest challenges through advanced engineering technologies in Space Systems, Commercial Solutions, and National Security and Defense. With applications including [@navigation#ai_tec*] and [@guidance#ai_tec*], [@communication#ai_tec*] and [@surveillance#ai_tec*] systems, [@electronic warfare#ai_tec*], [@aircraft systems#ai_tec*] and [@telemedicine#ai_tec*], [@SNC#Org*] provides state-of-the art solutions to military and commercial customers around the world.
