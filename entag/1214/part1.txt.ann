The [@U.S. military#Org*] wants to expand its use of [@artificial intelligence#ai_tec*] in warfare, but says it will take care to deploy the technology in accordance with the nation's values. The [@Pentagon#Org*] outlined its first [@AI#ai_tec*] strategy in a report released [@Tuesday#Date*]. The plan calls for accelerating the use of [@AI#ai_tec*] systems throughout the military, from intelligence-gathering operations to predicting maintenance problems in planes or ships. It urges the [@U.S.#Gpe*] to advance such technology swiftly before other countries chip away at its technological advantage. "Other nations, particularly [@China#Gpe*] and [@Russia#Gpe*], are making significant investments in [@AI#ai_tec*] for military purposes, including in applications that raise questions regarding international norms and human rights," the report says.  The report makes little mention of [@autonomous weapons#ai_product*] but cites an existing [@2012#Date*] military directive that requires humans to be in control. The [@U.S.#Gpe*] and [@Russia#Gpe*] are among a handful of nations that have blocked efforts at the [@United Nations#Org*] for an international ban on "[@killer robots#ai_product*]" â€” fully [@autonomous weapons#ai_product*] systems that could one day conduct war without human intervention. The [@U.S.#Gpe*] has argued that it's premature to try to regulate them. The strategy unveiled by the [@Department of Defense#Org*] this week is focused on more immediate applications, but even some of those have sparked ethical debates. The [@Pentagon#Org*] hit a roadblock in its [@AI#ai_tec*] efforts last year after internal protests at [@Google#Org*] led the tech company to drop out of [@Project Maven#ai_program*], which uses algorithms to interpret aerial video images from conflict zones. Other companies have sought to fill the vacuum, and the [@Pentagon#Org*] is working with [@AI#ai_tec*] experts from industry and academia to establish ethical guidelines for its [@AI#ai_tec*] applications. "Everything we've seen is with a human decision-maker in the loop," said [@Todd Probert#Person*], a vice president at [@Raytheon#Org*]'s intelligence division, which is working with the [@Pentagon#Org*] on [@Maven#ai_program*] and other projects. "It's using technology to help speed up the process but not supplant the command structure that's in place." The [@Pentagon#Org*]'s report follows President [@Donald Trump#Person*]'s Monday executive order prioritizing [@AI#ai_tec*] research across the government.
