Starting in [@2023#Date*], [@F-35#MISC*]s rolling off the production line will be outfitted with improved processors, more memory capacity and new, advanced displays in the cockpit — a suite of changes that the [@F-35#MISC*] program office calls "[@tech refresh 3#ai_program*]." Undergirding those upgrades is a transition to an open mission system architecture owned by the government, which will allow the services to create and upload custom software apps, [@F-35#MISC*] program head Vice Adm. [@Mat Winter#Person*] told reporters this month. In a statement, [@Lockheed#Org*] spokesman [@Mike Friedman#Person*] said the [@F-35#MISC*] is "ideally suited" for manned-unmanned teaming applications like [@Skyborg.#ai_program*] "Unlike 4th generation aircraft, the [@F-35#MISC*] is a force multiplier able to share its operational picture with ground, sea and air assets in the battlespace," [@Friedman#Person*] said. "[@Lockheed Martin#Org*] has extensive experience in manned/unmanned teaming and are working closely with our customers to develop and field this critical capability. Any timing for integration would be determined by our customers through the Continuous Capability, Development and Delivery (C2D2) framework for Follow on Modernization (FOM)." Meanwhile, [@Congress#Org*] must first decide whether to fund the [@F-15EX program#ai_program*] — a likely prospect considering the [@draft House#Org*] appropriations bill includes $986 million for eight jets. Boeing appears receptive to the potential upgrade. In an emailed statement, [@Prat Kumar#Person*], the company's vice president for the [@F-15 program#ai_program*], acknowledged the company is in talks with the [@Air Force#Org*] about a pathway to incorporate the [@F-15EX#ai_program*] into [@Skyborg.#ai_program*] "We are initiating early discussions with the [@U.S. Air Force#Org*] customer on how to insert contemporary technology such as this," he said. "The [@F-15EX#ai_program*] is a uniquely suited platform for such tech insertions as it has available computing capacity and space to continue offering new capabilities to the warfighter." The biggest challenges, [@Roper#Person*] said, may be technological and cultural — not financial. "I don't think there's a barrier in terms of funding," he said. "This is just different. There are going to be human factors, so how do you get a simulator to get you to do this? How do you get the [@AI#ai_tec*] in the attritable system? What do you do? What do you not allow it to do?" When [@Roper#Person*] recently visited the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the scientists he spoke to acknowledged that their [@AI#ai_tec*] research is driven by near-term commercial applications, like extending internet connectivity into everyday electronics. A future generation of [@AI#ai_tec*], like [@self-driving cars#ai_product*], will have to grapple with questions of trust and audibility, [@Roper#Person*] added. But the [@AI#ai_tec*] the [@Pentagon#Org*] wants would have to be more advanced from the get-go if the [@U.S. military#Org*] is to protect itself from adversaries seeking to exploit system capabilities — such as [@pattern recognition#ai_tec*], [@feature recognition#ai_tec*] and [@data extraction#ai_tec*] — by feeding it false information. "The current generation of [@AI#ai_tec*] does not deal with a world that understands how [@AI#ai_tec*] works and intentionally trying to throw a wrench in its machine. We will deal with that," [@Roper#Person*] explained. "We need to understand when the machine will be at its best and when the human will at its best. … We will need to get the person trained to have an instinct for [@AI#ai_tec*] just like they have an instinct for stealth," he said. "When is their [@AI#ai_tec*] giving them an advantage, and when is it not?"
