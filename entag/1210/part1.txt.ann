[@WASHINGTON#Gpe*] — The [@F-35#MISC*] and [@F-15EX#MISC*] fighter jets could get drone wingmen in the coming years, the [@U.S.#Gpe*] [@Air Force#Org*]'s top acquisition official revealed to [@Defense News#Org*]. The service is exploring ways to team [@Lockheed Martin#Org*]'s [@F-35#MISC*] and [@Boeing#Org*]'s new [@F-15EX#MISC*] with the [@XQ-58 Valkyrie drone#ai_product*] — a low-cost attritable fighter made by [@Kratos Defense#Org*] — or similar unmanned platforms. Attritable means that an asset is reusable, but inexpensive enough that the service can afford to lose it in battle. The [@Air Force#Org*] is in discussions with [@Boeing#Org*] and [@Lockheed#Org*] on the prospect, and the [@Air Force Research Laboratory#Org*] is working on the technology, [@Will Roper#Person*] said [@May 21#Date*] in an exclusive interview. "I'm very passionate about doing it, and the [@F-35#MISC*] has a wonderful opportunity to do this as part of Block 4," [@Roper#Person*] said, referring to the [@F-35#MISC*]'s upcoming upgrade program. "We might also have an opportunity to do this as part of [@F-15EX#MISC*]." [@Roper#Person*] told lawmakers this month that [@Valkyrie#ai_product*] would transition to a prototype program known as [@Skyborg#ai_program*], where the drone will be outfitted with new sensors and payloads and will be networked to manned fighter jets. [@In March#Date*], he characterized [@Skyborg#ai_program*] as an [@artificial intelligence#ai_tec*] wingman that would train and learn alongside pilots, or possibly be incorporated into a manned fighter cockpit to act as an assistant to the pilot like [@R2-D2#MISC*] in the "Star Wars" films. But until now, the [@Air Force#Org*] had not identified the platforms are under consideration to be equipped with [@Skyborg#ai_program*] or teamed with the [@XQ-58 Valkyrie#ai_product*]. The [@Valkyrie#ai_product*], which flew its first test flight at [@Yuma Proving Ground#MISC*], [@Arizona,#Gpe*] on [@March 5#Date*], was designed to perform and maneuver like a fighter jet. It can fly at high subsonic speeds, takeoff without a runway, and, according to [@Kratos,#Person*] meet or exceed the [@Air Force#Org*]'s requirement for a 1,500-nautical-mile range with a 500-pound payload. When produced in volume, [@Roper#Person*] predicted that they will cost "a couple million bucks" each — not cheap, but inexpensive compared to the [@F-35#MISC*]A and [@F-15EX#MISC*], which are expected to cost about $80 million per jet over the same time frame. The [@Air Force#Org*] is also assessing whether other [@unmanned aerial systems#ai_product*] would complement the [@Skyborg#ai_program*] program. A March request for information describes "a modular, fighter-like aircraft" that is autonomous and attritable, with open systems that allow it to be updated with new [@AI#ai_tec*] software or new hardware. Desired characteristics include the ability to detect and avoid obstacles and bad weather, and to takeoff and land autonomously. According to the solicitation, an "autonomous airborne system experimental campaign" could occur in fiscal years [@2019#Date*] and [@2020#Date*], with the hope of having an aircraft ready by [@2023#Date*]. [@Roper#Person*] said teaming fighters with drones could "open up the door for an entirely different way to do aerial combat." For example, take a typical four-aircraft formation and replace it with an [@F-15EX#MISC*] and three [@Valkyrie#ai_product*]s. "We can take risk with some systems to keep others safer," [@Roper#Person*] said. "We can separate the sensor and the shooter. Right now they're collocated on a single platform with a person in it. In the future, we can separate them out, put sensors ahead of shooters, put our manned systems behind the unmanned. There's a whole playbook." For the [@F-35#MISC*], the pathway to incorporating [@Skyborg#ai_program*] would involve writing software — similar to an iPhone application —that could be installed on the jet during its Block 4 modernization phase in the [@early 2020s#Date*].
