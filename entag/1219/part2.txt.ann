"We have done an in-depth study of where we are relative to the [@Chinese#Gpe*] and [@Russians#Gpe*] (across) the entire spectrum, and we've got some work to do," Selva said. "We have to figure out alternative pathways for communications and command and control so it doesn't have to be an RF (Radio Frequency) game…It's an RF game because we chose to make it so." He didn't specify what the alternatives to radio communication were, but there's been promising work using lasers to beam messages. (Breaking D readers will remember that we first reported the demise of America's lead in spectrum four years ago.) Securing our communications networks isn't enough, Work told me afterwards, because every weapon system now has chips in it that can be hacked into. "We have focused on securing network communications, but our biggest vulnerabilities now, Sydney, are in the DoD Internet of Things — the way you can crack into the network through platforms (e.g. tanks, aircraft, ships) and through components on platforms," Work said. "The [@Russians#Gpe*] and the [@Chinese#Gpe*] understand these vulnerabilities and really try to exploit them." So there are really three fronts in cyber/electronic warfare, and [@Work#Person*] isn't sanguine about any of them. "Dominating the electromagnetic spectrum, and securing the [@DoD#Org*] Internet of Things, and securing networks, all of these three things, in my view, we're well behind in," he told me. The whole "[@Chinese#Gpe*] theory of victory," he said, is known (in translation) as "systems destruction warfare" because it focuses on electronically paralyzing command-and-control rather than physically destroying tanks, ships, and planes. Now, [@artificial intelligence#ai_tec*] could potentially revolutionize [@electronic warfare#MISC*]. Computers can identify signals, trace them, and making jamming decisions much faster than human minds — a concept called "cognitive EW." But that's just one of the many military applications of [@AI#ai_tec*], from advising human commanders to coordinating swarms of [@combat robots#ai_product*]. While [@Selva#Person*] didn't address [@Artificial Intelligence#ai_tec*], [@Work#Person*] did; it's one of his passions and the central theme of the (now deprecated) [@Third Offset Strategy#MISC*]. So who's ahead in [@AI#ai_tec*]? [@Defense Innovation Advisory Board#Org*] chairman [@Eric Schmidt#Person*], a former [@Google#Org*] [@AI#ai_tec*] guru, told [@Work#Person*] he had once thought the [@US#Gpe*] was five years ahead of the [@Chinese#Gpe*], [@Work#Person*] recounted. But after a recent trip to [@China#Gpe*], [@Work#Person*] recounted, [@Schmidt#Person*] changed his verdict: "If we have six months, we're lucky." [@Schmidt#Person*] said last year that the [@US#Gpe*] lacks a coherent strategy to counter the [@Chinese#Gpe*] in this area. The [@US#Gpe*] has never been in a competition this intense, [@Work#Person*] said. [@China#Gpe*] has made [@AI#ai_tec*] an official national priority — something he thinks the [@White House#Org*] should do here — and the [@Chinese#Gpe*] have great coders. The [@Pentagon#Org*] is now creating a [@Joint Artificial Intelligence Center#Org*], something [@Schmidt#Person*]'s DIB proposed over a year ago, [@Work#Person*] noted. "We've got a lot of advantages and we can do very, very well in this race but don't take anything for granted," [@Work#Person*] told me. Just as politicians are warned never to take victory for granted, neither should [@DoD#Org*]. "It's a political rule to always run like you're losing, and that's what we have to do in this area….The [@Chinese#Gpe*] are very clever and very capable competitors, and they're intent on surpassing us."
