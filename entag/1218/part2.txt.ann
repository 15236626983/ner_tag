That preserves a vital role for the four armed services. "This is not an overly centralized process," [@Lewis#Person*] said. "It (the memo) emphasizes several times this is in collaboration with the services…. It brings focus and it brings enablers that are then used by the different services."What's not clear yet, [@Lewis#Person*] said, is the role of the undersecretary for research and engineering, [@Mike Griffin#Person*]. That's something that the [@Pentagon#Org*] will have to work out over time, perhaps as part of its forthcoming [@AI#ai_tec*] strategy. How does [@JAIC#Org*] compare to competitors' efforts in [@AI#ai_tec*]? The [@Chinese government#Org*] has officially made global dominance in [@AI#ai_tec*] a national priority, while [@Russia#Gpe*] constantly touts its [@combat robots#ai_product*] field-tested in [@Syria#Gpe*] and elsewhere.  "Within the [@Russian Ministry of Defense#Org*], there are now two centers responsible for the development of the latest breakthrough technologies, such as [@autonomous weapons#ai_product*], but no specific agency-wide effort to develop [@AI#ai_tec*] center like [@JAIC#Org*]," said [@CNA#Org*] scholar [@Sam Bendett#Person*], a close observer of [@Russian#Gpe*] military technology. "On the other hand, the [@MOD#Org*] has lots of [@AI#ai_tec*] and other high-tech R&D taking place amongst its numerous academic institutions, an effort that the [@MOD#Org*] is keen on consolidating further.' In fact, in a development strangely reminiscent of the Soviet era, the [@Russians#Gpe*] are actually building a "city" on the [@Black Sea#Gpe*] for [@AI#ai_tec*] and related research, with a planned population of at least 2,000 engineers and scientists by [@2020#Date*]. "Currently, lots of efforts are going towards the establishment and staffing of the Era 'technopolis,'" said [@Bendett#Person*], "a 50-acre city with S&T and R&D centers/laboratories and living spaces for soldiers and private sector workers who will be developing numerous projects for the nation's military, with a specific focus on [@AI#ai_tec*], autonomy and big data analytics." The [@Russians#Gpe*] are watching [@US#Gpe*] developments closely and will probably react to [@JAIC#Org*]'s creation with "a certain degree of apprehension," [@Bendett#Person*] told me, mainly because of how it might help the [@Pentagon#Org*] tap into [@America#Gpe*]'s massive private sector investment in artificial intelligence. "Currently, [@Russian#Gpe*] [@AI#ai_tec*] funding is only a small fraction of what is spent in the [@US#Gpe*], or [@China#Gpe*], for that matter," he said. "We do have a very strong commercial sector," agreed fellow [@CNA#Org*] analyst [@Larry Lewis#Person*], "but unlike [@China#Gpe*] we are going to be more challenged to leverage that for national security, as we've seen with the example in [@Google#Org*]." [@Google#Org*]'s decision to opt out of a military contract would simply be unthinkable for a [@Chinese company#Org*], he told me: "In [@China#Gpe*], you're free to do business but if the government wants something of yours, it's theirs." "At the highest levels, the [@Chinese government#Org*] is prioritizing and directing strong state support to [@AI#ai_tec*] development, leveraging and harnessing the dynamism of the 'national champions,' including [@Baidu#Org*], [@Alibaba#Org*], and [@Tencent#Org*], that are at the forefront of [@China#Gpe*]'s [@AI#ai_tec*] revolution," said [@CNAS#Org*] scholar [@Elsa Kania#Person*]. "[@China#Gpe*]'s approach might be characterized as state-driven but market-centric, with an integrated approach (combing) academia, tech companies, the defense industry, and the military…..a national strategy of civil-military fusion." "For instance, [@Baidu#Org*] is partnering with the [@CETC#Org*], a major state-owned defense conglomerate, through the [@Joint Laboratory for Intelligent Command and Control Technologies#Org*], which seeks to advance the use of [@big data#ai_tec*], [@artificial intelligence#ai_tec*], and [@cloud computing#ai_tec*] for military command and information systems," [@Kania#Person*] went on. "This spring, the [@Chinese military#Org*] launched what might be characterized as a would-be [@DIUx#ai_product*] with [@Chinese#Gpe*] characteristics. This 'rapid response team,' launched in [@Shenzhen#Gpe*], is intended to (enhance) the [@PLA#Org*]'s capability to leverage advanced commercial technologies for military purposes." So while the [@US#Gpe*] has strong tradition of innovation, entrepreneurship, and individual creativity, [@China#Gpe*] is investing heavily in [@AI#ai_tec*], its capabilities are growing rapidly, and its government is systematically tapping civilian innovation for military use. But that's not all. "The other strength that they have is they have lots and lots of data" to train [@machine learning algorithms#ai_tec*], [@Lewis#Person*] noted. "[@China#Gpe*] has many more people, they don't have privacy concerns, so they have advantages there that we don't have." "The major challenge for the [@US#Gpe*] is [@China#Gpe*]," [@Lewis#Person*] said. "Not only do they have comparable capabilities in the commercial sector, which is really important, but….they have a national strategy. They are approaching the use of [@AI#ai_tec*] just like the [@US#Gpe*] approached going to the moon in the sixties."
