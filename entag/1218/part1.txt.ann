[@WASHINGTON#Gpe*]: The [@Pentagon#Org*] has created a new [@Joint Artificial Intelligence Center#Org*] ([@JAIC#Org*]) that will have oversight over almost all service and defense agency [@AI#ai_tec*] efforts. This coordination function is crucial to the emerging [@AI#ai_tec*] arms race with [@Russia#Gpe*] and [@China#Gpe*], experts told us.The [@JAIC#Org*] will report to Chief Information Officer [@Dana Deasy#Person*], the establishing memo by Deputy Defense Secretary [@Patrick Shanahan#Person*] says. Its ambit is not quite untrammeled; any projects under $15 million remain the authority of the service or agency. The [@JAIC#Org*] will establish a common set of [@AI#ai_tec*] "standards…. tools, shared data, reusable technology, processes, and expertise" for the whole [@Defense Department#Org*], according to the [@June 27#Date*] memo. Undersecretary for Research & Engineering [@Mike Griffin#Person*], a far more prominent proponent of [@AI#ai_tec*] and other cutting-edge technologies who has warned [@China#Gpe*] and [@Russia#Gpe*] are catching up to the [@US#Gpe*], "will continue to promote development of new [@AI#ai_tec*] technologies, systems, and concepts" but without any clearly specified role in the new center. CIO [@Deasy#Person*] has 30 days to consult the rest of the department and report back with a list of initial "[@National Mission Initiatives#ai_program*]" for [@JAIC#Org*] to start working on in 90 days, by [@September 27#Date*]. Even though that start date is just three days before the end of fiscal year [@2018#Date*], '18 funding will be made available ASAP to "enable implementation of select [@AI#ai_tec*] initiatives in FY 18," the memo makes clear. The '18 funds may well require congressional approval for a budget reprogramming action, while [@2019#Date*] money will require an amendment or supplement to appropriations bills already moving through [@Congress.#Org*] [@Shanahan#Person*] specifies that the first [@National Mission Initiative#ai_program*] will be the controversial [@Project Maven#ai_program*], already in progress. [@Google#Org*] is withdrawing from its [@Maven#ai_program*] contract after employees objected that the military's use of [@Google#Org*] [@AI#ai_tec*] to analyze surveillance video could be used to target lethal drone strikes. ([@Project Maven#ai_program*] founder and former Deputy Defense Secretary [@Bob Work#Person*] has countered it could also save lives by killing terrorists before they attack or preventing [@US#Gpe*] strikes that might cause collateral damage. He also notes that [@Google#Org*] is working with elements of the [@Chinese government#Org*] on [@AI#ai_tec*].) No doubt with this debate in mind, [@Shanahan#Person*] writes in the very first paragraph of the memo that "we must pursue [@AI#ai_tec*] applications with boldness and alacrity while ensuring strong commitment to military ethics and [@AI#ai_tec*] safety." [@Shanahan#Person*] directs CIO [@Deasy#Person*] to consult with the services, Joint Staff, combatant commands, and other [@DoD#Org*] entities on the initial list of [@National Mission Initiatives#ai_program*]. Those entities, in return, are to "coordinate" with the CIO on "each [@AI#ai_tec*] initiative that totals more than $15 million annually," although that threshold "will be reviewed annually as investments in [@AI#ai_tec*] mature" — which presumably means it'll go up as [@AI#ai_tec*] projects become more routine. (For scale, [@Google#Org*]'s initial [@Project Maven#ai_program*] contract was just $9 million, but the company projected it would swiftly grow to $15 million and ultimately $250 million).  [@JAIC#Org*] will also coordinate with other government agencies, "industry, academics, and [@U.S.#Gpe*] allies," the memo says. "Harnessing the strengths of industry and academia (is crucial) and that is explicitly called out," said [@Larry Lewis#Person*], director of [@CNA#Org*]'s Center for Autonomy and [@AI#ai_tec*]. "It's not necessarily going to be easy, but including the discussion about ethics and [@AI#ai_tec*] safety (so prominently) is going to be an important piece of that."  "I'm very excited to hear about the stand up of the new [@JAIC#Org*]," said [@Bob Work#Person*], former deputy secretary of defense and one of the [@Pentagon#Org*]'s foremost proponents of artificial intelligence. "The [@Defense Innovation Board recommended the Department#Org*] create an [@AI Center of Excellence#Org*] nearly a year and a half ago. Although I wish it had not taken this long to (create it), the [@JAIC#Org*] is an important step forward in exploring and pushing [@AI#ai_tec*] and [@machine learning#ai_tec*] throughout the department, for both operational and business applications." "The [@JAIC#Org*]'s initial funding is quite modest, and we have a lot to learn about its mission and activities," [@Work#Person*] cautioned. "But its standup is a welcome first step in response to [@Chinese#Gpe*], and to a lesser extent, [@Russia#Gpe*]n, plans to dominate these technologies." "This is a big deal," [@CNA#Org*]'s [@Lewis#Person*] agreed. "This is an acknowledgment that the [@US#Gpe*] is in a new, competitive security environment and that [@AI#ai_tec*] is likely to be decisive.""It gives organizational focus," [@Lewis#Person*] said of the [@JAIC#Org*]. In [@Shanahan#Person*]'s memo, "it talks about bringing to bear resources and expertise, and then it talks about providing foundational pieces that [@DoD#Org*] is currently missing." "One of those is data processes, curating data," [@Lewis#Person*] continued "We have many systems out there that collect intelligence or collect surveillance, but we don't necessarily keep it all, and we don't necessarily have it in formats that can be easily exploited with [@machine learning#ai_tec*]" — indeed, many of the formats aren't even compatible with each other — "so we have some foundational work to do to be able to bring all the data that we have to bear." Massed data is critical because modern [@AI#ai_tec*]s refine their algorithms through [@machine learning#ai_tec*], and the more data they have to go through, the better. (That's assuming the data is not polluted by unintentional bias or deliberate disinformation). Beyond creating a pool of data, the [@JAIC#Org*] mission also includes creating common processes, technologies, and tools that all of [@DoD#Org*] can draw on, as well as a central body of [@AI#ai_tec*] experts to consult with. "You don't need everyone to be a PhD data science person," [@Lewis#Person*] said. "You have some experts that can develop algorithms, (but) you have to marry that technical expertise with people who understand (military) operations."
