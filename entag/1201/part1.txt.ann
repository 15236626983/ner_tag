The [@Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency#Org*] ([@DARPA#Org*]) and [@Dynetics#Org*] have achieved a significant milestone with the development of the new unique [@Gremlins air vehicle#ai_product*].[@Dynetics#Org*] announced that the new [@X-61A Gremlins Air Vehicle#ai_product*] ([@GAV#ai_product*]) had successfully performed its maiden flight in [@November 2019#Date*].The test took place at [@Dugway Proving Ground#MISC*] near [@Salt Lake City#Gpe*], Utah. Testing operations involved one captive-carry mission aboard a [@TBM#Org*] Inc. C-130A and an airborne launch and free flight of the [@X-61A#ai_product*] that lasted one hour and 41 minutes. The test objectives included:Demonstrating a successful launch of the [@GAV#ai_product*] from the C-130;Demonstrating a rate capture, wing deployment, cold engine start, and transition to stable, powered flight; Collecting data on [@GAV#ai_product*] subsystem operation and performance;Verifying air and ground-based command and control systems, including data link performance and handovers between air and ground control;Deploying the [@GAV#ai_product*] docking arm;Demonstrating the flight termination and ground (parachute) recovery of the [@GAV#ai_product*] (demonstration system only – not part of the operational system).The [@X-61A#ai_product*] flew as predicted with no anomalies, achieving all test objectives that relate to the operational system. At the end of the mission, the engine was shut down and a drogue chute successfully deployed to terminate flight. Unfortunately, the vehicle was lost during the ground recovery sequence due to a failure to extract the main chute. Managed out of [@DARPA#Org*]'s [@Tactical Technology Office#Org*] ([@TTO#Org*]), the overarching goal of Gremlins is to accelerate the ability to perform aerial launch and recovery of volley quantities of low-cost, reusable [@unmanned aerial systems#ai_product*] ([@UASs#ai_product*]). This test is the next step toward the completion of the program's Phase 3 demonstration objectives, which include a final flight test to demonstrate the ability to recover four [@GAV#ai_product*]s in under 30 minutes."This flight marks a historic milestone for [@Dynetics#Org*] and the [@Gremlins program#ai_program*]," said [@Tim Keeter#Person*], [@Dynetics#Org*] [@Gremlins program#ai_program*] manager. "The [@GAV#ai_product*] flew beautifully and our command and control system kept us in total control of the [@GAV#ai_product*] for the entire flight. The loss of our vehicle validates our decision to build five [@GAV#ai_product*]s for Phase 3; we still have four remaining. Overall, I am proud to see all the hard work pay off and we are excited to continue this momentum towards the first airborne recovery in [@early 2020#Date*]."The Gremlins team celebrated a number of milestones in [@2019#Date*] including a successful flight test of the docking system in February. In March, they executed the first flight of the [@GAV#ai_product*] avionics system, installed onboard the [@Calspan Variable Stability System#ai_product*] ([@VSS#ai_product*]) Lear Jet as a dress rehearsal for this [@November 2019#Date*] test. [@Dynetics#Org*] also hosted a stakeholder's day highlighting a live engine test in July and received a [@U.S#Gpe*]. Air Force-assigned [@X-61A#ai_product*] designation in August. The [@Dynetics#Org*] team was one of four companies awarded Phase 1 in [@2016.#Date*] Phase 2 was awarded in [@March 2017#Date*] to two of those four performers, and Phase 3 followed in [@April 2018#Date*], naming [@Dynetics#Org*] the top performer."This flight test validates all the engineering design work, analysis, and ground testing we have performed in the past two and a half years," [@Brandon Hiller#Person*], chief engineer for the [@X-61A#ai_product*] said. "We have a lot of confidence in the vehicle’s performance and overall design going forward, and the telemetry data from the flight compares exceptionally well to our modeling predictions. Our team has done a superb job to achieve first flight of this unique aircraft in such a short amount of time, and we are eager to get this new capability into the hands of the [@DoD#Org*]."
