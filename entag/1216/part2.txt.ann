The algorithms must have labeled, or what is often referred to as structured, data to work with as opposed to raw data or unstructured data. Without it, the algorithms struggle to complete their work. [@Floyd#Person*] said one approach to the data labeling issue is grabbing airmen that are waiting on their security clearances to do the labeling. "Some of our best pockets of data labelers are folks that are waiting orders or waiting to get their clearance and it's just been tremendous," he said. "That becomes their service to their country for those first three or four months while they're waiting to get in the front door at [@Fort Meade#Gpe*] or some other place like that." User interfaces for the operators and analysts leveraging the algorithms must be tailorable and adaptable, [@Floyd#Person*] said. "We need to give the user interface to the operators to where they can choose the algorithm they want to use for the mission that they're on. An algorithm that's tailored for this area of the world won't be perfect for another area of the world," he explained. "We know that we'll have tailored algorithms for different geographic regions." One of the most important aspects of deploying algorithms in conflict is going to be how operators use it, [@Floyd#Person*] said describing a "slide rule" of confidence regarding the algorithm's performance. Some operators might want the algorithm to cue things that it's 80 percent or higher in, he said. Others might say slide the confidence down to 20 percent because that might return hits the human wouldn't normally see. "We have seen that a couple of times already in the deployed environment where the algorithm picked up things the human eye missed," [@Floyd#Person*] said. [@Floyd#Person*] said [@DoD#Org*] is still in the early stages of [@Project Maven#ai_program*] adding that while the technology has been deployed in six locations, more are on the way. There's a pathway for additional sites in the [@U.S.#Gpe*] and overseas throughout the rest of the year. He alluded to additional use cases or applications beyond full motion video for [@Project Maven#ai_program*]. "It might be a little early to get too specific on those. But there might be another use case or two, another sensor type or two that we might go after soon," he said.
